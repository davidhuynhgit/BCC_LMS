# Brisbane City Council Library Management System – Data Analysis Project

## 📚 Overview

This project explores and analyzes multiple public datasets from the **Brisbane City Council Library System** to understand borrowing behavior, resource utilization, and operational trends across various branches. The goal is to clean, structure, and synthesize the data to extract meaningful insights using a combination of **Python (Google Colab)** for preprocessing and **SQL** for querying and analysis.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Preprocess multiple datasets including:
  - Library transaction records
  - Branch and location metadata
  - Item-level resource metadata

- Clean and integrate datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy

- Design a relational database schema for efficient querying

- Prepare for SQL-based analysis to uncover:
  - Borrowing trends over time
  - Most popular items and categories
  - Branch-level performance comparisons
  - User behavior insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab)**: Data cleaning, transformation, and integration  
- **SQL (Planned)**: Data modeling and insight extraction
