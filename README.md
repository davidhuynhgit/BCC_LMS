📚 Overview
This project explores and analyzes multiple public datasets from the Brisbane City Council Library System to understand borrowing behavior, resource utilization, and operational trends across various branches. The goal is to clean, structure, and synthesize the data to extract meaningful insights using a combination of Python (Google Colab) for preprocessing and SQL for querying and analysis.

🧠 Objectives
Preprocess multiple datasets including:

Library transaction records

Branch and location metadata

Item-level resource metadata

Clean and integrate datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy

Design a relational database schema for efficient querying

Prepare for SQL-based analysis to uncover:

Borrowing trends over time

Most popular items and categories

Branch-level performance comparisons

User behavior insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Google Colab): Data cleaning, transformation, and integration

Libraries: pandas, numpy, datetime, re

SQL (Planned): Data modeling and insight extraction

Power BI (Future Scope): Visualization of trends and metrics

✅ Current Progress
 Imported and explored raw datasets

 Handled missing values and inconsistent formats

 Standardized key fields for joining and analysis

 Design relational schema in SQL

 Load cleaned data into SQL database

 Perform exploratory data analysis

 Visualize results (planned)

📈 Planned Insights
Peak borrowing hours and days across branches

Item popularity by category and location

Lending trends over time

User behavior patterns and borrowing frequency

🔍 Project Motivation
This project is part of a self-directed data portfolio to demonstrate practical skills in:

Real-world data preprocessing and integration

SQL schema design and query logic

Critical thinking and problem-solving in analytics

Communicating actionable insights using clean, structured data
